#One duplicate was observed with a data size of 248 mice in the clean dataset.
#Among the 10 drugs used, Ketapril was shown to have the biggest Tumor Volume on average (55.235638 m3). Ramicane was shown to have the smallest Tumor Volume on average (40.216745 m3) and this was followed by Capomulin (Tumor Volume on average =40.675741 m3).
#From the Bar Chart, Capomulin was shown to have the highest total number of measures taken. This was followed by Ramicane.
#From the Pie Chart, there were more male mice (51.0%) than female mice (49.0%) in this study population.
#No potential outlier was observed across four drugs (Caponmulin, Ramicane, Infubinol, Ceftamin) except Infubinol with one final tumor volume below the lower bound of its quartile analysis.
#From the quartile analysis and its box plot, Ramicare was shown to have a bit larger interquartile range than Capomulin in the final turmor volume. Both have lower median final tumor volume than Infubinol and Certamin in the final tumor volume.
#This was further shown in the downward trend observed in the Capmulin treatment of mouse b128 across time.
#From the scatter plots and the analysis of correlation and regression, the average tumor volume was shown to be positively correlated with the increase in weight (r=0.84) in the Capomulin regimen.
